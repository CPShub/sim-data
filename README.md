* [Data on the effective constitutive behavior of soft 3D beam-lattice metamaterials](beam_lattice_metamaterials.ipynb)
	* This dataset was used in the work "Anisotropic hyperelastic material models for finite deformations combining material theory and data-driven approaches with application to cubic lattice metamaterials" by M. Fernández, M. Jamshidian, T. Böhlke, K. Kersting and O. Weeger (in preparation).
